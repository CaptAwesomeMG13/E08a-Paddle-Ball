This is the first Godot exercise for BL-MSCH-C220. As usual, Fork and Clone this repository.

This first attempt at Godot started off rough but has come together pretty well.
Its just a basic brick breaker type of game and tiles can be added later 
through the assets that are provided. Hope you enjoy the project.
